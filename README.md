# pedigree
A family tree pedigree project that works through an MVC Sinatra App using ActiveRecord with validations to ensure proper data input,  many-to-many relationships and isolated user accounts.  


everytime an individual is made. it can be a brother sister, cousin son. 

but all i need is the family

and the individual

every instance becomes a family member. you have to put in who is related to who. and every one creates a new instance.
